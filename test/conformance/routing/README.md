# Router back-compat conformance corpus

A corpus of golden `policy → Decision` conformance cases for the
back-compat rule: a future server must never break a policy authored against an
earlier schema major. A runner replays each case through the routing engine and
compares the produced `Decision` with the recorded one: every field, every
value, no tolerance. (The comparison is on parsed JSON, so key order and
formatting do not matter — only the values.) Any drift is a back-compat
violation.

## Layout

```
routing/<schema_major>/<case>/
  policy.json    # a collection.router policy authored at that schema major
  cases.jsonl    # one request → expected Decision per line
```

A `<schema_major>` directory holds case directories and nothing else, and each case
directory is a leaf. The runner fails on anything else, so a stray file or a broken
symlink cannot quietly drop cases.

`<schema_major>` is the policy's root `version`. Cases are
grouped by the **engine behavior they lock**, so the
corpus reads as a checklist against the v1 semantics table in
`src/cpp/resources/schemas/README.md`.

```

  l1_conditions_char_bounds/  # min_chars / max_chars (own policy: length rules are greedy)
  l1_conditions_total_char_bounds/  # min_total_chars / max_total_chars over the whole request
  l1_conditions_features/     # boolean request-feature ops: has_tools / has_images

  l1_outputs/                 # matched rule's nested outputs bag copied verbatim into Decision
  l1_resolution/              # rule-list resolution: first-match-wins, fail-open default
  l1_trace/                   # route_trace=true: per-leaf trace, accumulation, short-circuit, default
  # l2_semantic/              # stubbed semantic_similarity — to be added
  # l3_classifier/            # stubbed classifier             — to be added
  # l0a_router/               # stubbed llm router + desugaring — to be added

  ...
```

The `l1_conditions_*` and `l1_resolution` groups are **deterministic** — they replay with an
empty `ClassifierServices` (no model backend). The `l2` / `l3` / `l0a` groups are
**stubbed model-backed** cases (pinned fake `ClassifierServices`); they are *to be
added* and will carry per-case stub outputs.

## `cases.jsonl` line schema

Each line is one JSON object:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Unique, human-readable case id within the file. One case locks one behavior. |
| `request` | A request body in any form `build_route_context` accepts: chat-completions (`messages`), legacy completions (`prompt`), or Responses (`input`), plus optional `model`, `metadata`, `tools`, and `route_trace`. The engine input is the last user message (or the `prompt`/`input` text); `min_chars`/`max_chars` count its UTF-8 bytes, while `min_total_chars`/`max_total_chars` count the UTF-8 bytes of every text part the body carries. |
| `decision` | The exact `Decision` the engine must emit: `version`, `route_to`, `matched_rule` (empty on fall-through), `default_used`, `outputs`. |
| `note` | Optional. Free-text annotation for a non-obvious case; ignored by the runner. |

## Coverage matrix

One deterministic semantic per row → the single case that locks it. The
matrix is the sufficiency argument: every deterministic behavior the engine
defines for v1 has exactly one lock, and combinators/resolution are tested once
(they are op-agnostic) rather than across every leaf.

The one trace-emitting family not locked above is the classifier band (`classifier:<id>`),
which is model-backed and non-deterministic — it arrives with the stubbed `l2`/`l3`/`l0a`
groups below.

The regex **dialect** is also not locked. The engine builds patterns with
`std::regex::ECMAScript`, but the corpus patterns use syntax that every regex grammar
shares, so the cases would still pass if that setting changed. Locking it needs a
pattern with ECMAScript-only syntax, such as `\d`.

Stubbed model-backed semantics (`min_score`/`max_score` band, `semantic_similarity`
max-cosine, `classifier` label resolution, `llm` router desugaring, `on_error`
fail-open) — *to be added* with the `l2` / `l3` / `l0a` groups.
