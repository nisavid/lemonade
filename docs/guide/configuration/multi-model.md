# Multi-Model Support

Lemonade supports loading multiple models simultaneously, allowing you to keep frequently-used models in memory for faster switching. The server uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache policy to automatically manage model eviction when limits are reached.

## Configuration

Configure the per-type slot limit via `lemonade config set max_loaded_models=N`. Configure the GPU memory budget via `lemonade config set max_gpu_memory_occupancy_gb=N`. See [Server Configuration](./README.md).

**Default:** `1` (one model of each type). Use `-1` for unlimited.

`max_gpu_memory_occupancy_gb` defaults to `-1`, which means Lemonade uses the detected total GPU capacity. At load time, Lemonade uses the smaller of the configured budget and the memory currently available to Lemonade: free GPU memory plus the GPU memory already occupied by loaded Lemonade models.

## Model Types

Models are categorized into these types:

- **LLM** - Chat and completion models (default type)
- **Embedding** - Models for generating text embeddings (identified by the `embeddings` label)
- **Reranking** - Models for document reranking (identified by the `reranking` label)
- **Transcription** - Models for audio transcription using Whisper (identified by the `transcription` label)
- **Image** - Models for image generation (identified by the `image` label)

Each type has its own independent LRU cache, all sharing the same slot limit set by `max_loaded_models`.

## Router and Classifier Dependencies

Models loaded internally to choose a candidate use a separate **routing-helper**
residency pool. This is intentionally independent from both `ModelType` and the
backend's hardware slot policy:

- A router LLM remains an **LLM**; it is not reclassified as a classification model.
- Standard pools continue to use `max_loaded_models` per `ModelType`.
- Routing-helper capacity is keyed by the distinct helper model rather than by
  `ModelType`. Multiple classifier or router models of the same type required by
  one or more policies can therefore remain warm together without consuming or
  evicting standard user-facing slots. A second process for the same helper model
  is never created.
- With the default `max_loaded_models=1`, a router LLM and one selected standard
  LLM candidate can stay warm together; additional distinct helper models can
  also remain resident until explicit or pressure-based eviction removes them.
- Residency follows the current use of the live process. A standard model used
  as a routing dependency is promoted in place; a routing helper called directly
  by the user is demoted into the counted standard pool in place. Destination-pool
  admission and pinning rules apply before either transition. The
  `router.model == candidate` case therefore promotes for routing and demotes for
  candidate inference within the same request without creating a second process.
- Pinning is pool-local for count-based LRU: a pinned normal candidate does not
  block the routing-helper slot, and a pinned helper does not block normal slots.
- Cloud (`Unmetered`) models consume neither pool and report `slot_pool: unmetered`.
- Implicit model selection prefers a normal `standard` model, so a warm internal
  helper never makes an otherwise unique candidate ambiguous.
- Explicit idle/VRAM-pressure eviction remains independent; an unpinned routing
  helper can still be evicted when dynamic eviction is enabled.
- Backend/device constraints remain authoritative. Internal routing work never
  evicts an already-resident model to acquire an exclusive hardware slot; that
  attempt fails with HTTP `409` and code `router_residency_conflict`. This also
  prevents two incompatible NPU/FLM helpers from repeatedly evicting one another.
  A direct user request has precedence and may evict a resident routing helper
  through the backend's normal exclusivity policy.

`GET /api/v1/health` exposes `residency_class` and `slot_pool` for every live model.
`pinned_models` remains the standard-pool summary used with `max_models`, while
`pinned_helper_models` separately reports pinned routing helpers by `ModelType`.

## Device Constraints

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: npu-exclusivity -->
- **NPU Exclusivity:** `whispercpp`, `flm`, and `ryzenai-llm` are mutually exclusive on the NPU.
<!-- END GENERATED: npu-exclusivity -->
    - Loading a model from one of these backends will automatically evict all NPU models from the other backends.
    - `flm` supports loading 1 ASR model, 1 LLM, and 1 embedding model on the NPU at the same time.
    - `ryzenai-llm` supports loading exactly 1 LLM, which uses the entire NPU.
    - `whispercpp` supports loading exactly 1 ASR model at a time, which uses the entire NPU.
- **GPU:** Lemonade predicts the requested model's GPU occupancy before starting the backend. If the projected occupancy exceeds the active GPU memory budget, loaded GPU models are evicted from largest to smallest until the requested model fits.
- **CPU:** No inherent limit beyond available RAM.

## Eviction Policy

When a model slot is full:
1. The least recently used model of that type is evicted
2. The new model is loaded
3. If loading fails (except file-not-found errors), all models are evicted and the load is retried

When a GPU memory budget would be exceeded:
1. Lemonade dry-runs the eviction plan before unloading anything
2. Loaded GPU models are selected from largest to smallest predicted or measured occupancy
3. If the requested model cannot fit even after evicting all eligible models, the load fails and existing models remain loaded

Models currently processing inference requests cannot be evicted until they finish.

## Dynamic VRAM Management (opt-in)

In addition to the slot-based LRU policy, Lemonade can dynamically free VRAM based on **idle time** and **global GPU memory pressure**, so the server coexists with other GPU-heavy apps (ComfyUI, Blender, games) while minimizing cold starts. This feature is **opt-in** and disabled by default.

Enable it globally:

```
lemonade config set auto_evict=true
lemonade config set auto_evict_threshold_pct=0.90   # yield VRAM at 90% global usage
```

A background monitor samples global VRAM usage (NVIDIA via `nvidia-smi`, AMD via sysfs on Linux). When usage crosses `auto_evict_threshold_pct`, the eviction engine frees the most disposable model. When `auto_evict` is disabled, no VRAM polling occurs.

**Tiered degradation.** Idle models degrade in two stages rather than a binary loaded/unloaded:

1. **Soft idle (downsize):** after `downsize_idle_timeout` seconds idle, the KV cache/context is cleared to free dynamic memory while base weights stay resident. The next request transparently restores it.
2. **Hard idle / pressure (evict):** after `evict_idle_timeout` seconds idle, or under VRAM pressure, the model is fully unloaded (VRAM released; the weights file stays in the OS page cache for a fast reload).

**Load-time-weighted scoring.** Under pressure, the engine evicts by:

```
eviction_score = idle_time_ms / (load_duration_ms * evict_weight_factor)
```

Higher score = more disposable. Fast-loading models are evicted first; slow/expensive loads are protected. Raise `evict_weight_factor` on a model to protect it further.

A request that arrives while a model is mid-downsize or mid-eviction transparently interrupts the transition and is served — no failed generations.

### Per-model eviction settings

These can be set per model on `/api/v1/load` (or globally where noted):

| Setting | Scope | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auto_evict` | global + per-model | `false` | Opt this model/server into dynamic eviction |
| `auto_evict_threshold_pct` | global | `0.90` | Global VRAM fraction that triggers pressure eviction |
| `downsize_idle_timeout` | per-model | `60` | Seconds idle before soft downsize |
| `evict_idle_timeout` | per-model | `300` | Seconds idle before full eviction |
| `evict_weight_factor` | per-model | `1.0` | Eviction-protection weight (higher = more protected) |

## Model Pinning

To prevent frequently used models from being auto-evicted by the LRU policy, you can "pin" them in memory. Pinned models are excluded from the eviction candidate search.

### Pinning Behavior

- **Load-time Pinning:** You can request a model to be pinned when loading it by passing the `--pinned` flag in the CLI:
  ```bash
  lemonade load Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF --pinned
  ```
  Or by setting `"pinned": true` in the POST request body to `/api/v1/load`.
- **Dynamic Pinning/Unpinning:** Toggles the pinned status of a currently loaded model dynamically without needing a reload:
  ```bash
  lemonade pin Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF
  lemonade unpin Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF
  ```
  Or via a POST request to `/internal/pin`.
- **Pre-emptive Warnings:** The CLI checks `/api/v1/health` before loading a new model. If all slots for that model type are occupied by pinned models, the CLI will output a pre-emptive warning alerting you that loading will fail.
- **Capacity Failures:** If every model in the target `(residency class, model type)` pool is pinned and another model needs that pool, the load request fails with a `409 Conflict` HTTP status containing a `slots_pinned_error` code. You must unpin or unload a model from that pool to free its slot.

## Per-Model Settings

Each model can be loaded with custom settings (context size, llamacpp backend, llamacpp args) via the `/api/v1/load` endpoint. These per-model settings override the default values set via CLI arguments or environment variables. See the [`/api/v1/load` endpoint documentation](../../api/lemonade.md#post-v1load) for details.

**Setting Priority Order:**
1. Values passed explicitly in `/api/v1/load` request (highest priority)
2. Per-model values from `recipe_options.json`
3. Per-architecture defaults from `architecture_defaults.json` (shipped resource; keyed by GGUF architecture name)
4. Values from environment variables or server startup arguments (see [Server Configuration](./README.md))
5. Hardcoded defaults in `lemond` (lowest priority)
