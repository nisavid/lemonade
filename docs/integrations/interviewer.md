# Interviewer

## Overview

**Interviewer** is an AI-powered interview practice application designed to help candidates prepare for real job interviews through voice-enabled mock sessions. Built with a **local-first privacy** approach, it runs entirely on your own hardware with no data ever leaving your machine.

The application generates dynamic, context-aware interviewer personas based on actual job descriptions and your resume, conducts multi-phase technical and behavioral interviews with real-time voice interaction, and provides comprehensive, actionable feedback.

## Features

- **Voice-Enabled Interviews** - Realistic interview simulation with speech-to-text (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS)
- **Local AI Models** - Runs entirely on your hardware via Lemonade Server with no cloud dependencies
- **Smart Document Extraction** - AI-powered parsing of resumes and job descriptions
- **Dynamic Persona Generation** - Creates tailored interviewer personas based on job/role
- **Comprehensive Feedback** - Detailed performance analysis with actionable insights
- **Privacy-First** - All data stored locally in JSON format
- **Cross-Platform Desktop App** - Electron-based for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Lemonade Server** by following the [Lemonade Server Instructions](../guide/install/README.md)
2. **Node.js 20+** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
3. **Git** - For cloning the repository

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/interviewer.git
cd interviewer

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Start Lemonade Server

Start Lemonade Server using the desktop app or CLI:

```bash
# Using the desktop app - click the lemon icon (LemonadeServer.exe on Windows, lemonade-tray on macOS/Linux)
# Or using the CLI to start the HTTP server directly:
lemond
```

### 3. Pull Required Models

Interviewer uses multiple AI models for different capabilities. Pull the recommended models:

```bash
# LLM for interview logic and feedback (recommended: Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF)
lemonade pull Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF

# Whisper-Base for speech-to-text (automatic transcription)
lemonade pull Whisper-Base

# Kokoro for text-to-speech (natural voice synthesis)
lemonade pull kokoro-v1
```

### 4. Run Interviewer

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Or build for production
npm run build
npm run build:electron
```

## Model Recommendations

Based on testing, the following models work well with Interviewer:

| Capability | Recommended Model |
|------------|------------------|
| LLM (Interview Logic) | Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF |
| ASR (Transcription) | Whisper-Base |
| TTS (Voice) | kokoro-v1 |

**Hardware Requirements:**
- Tested on AMD Strix Halo with 128GB RAM
- Minimum 32GB RAM recommended for larger models
- GPU acceleration recommended for faster responses

## How It Works

Interviewer leverages Lemonade Server for all AI inference:

1. **Resume/Job Parsing** - Uses LLM to extract key skills, requirements, and context
2. **Persona Generation** - Creates an interviewer persona tailored to the job description
3. **Question Generation** - Dynamically generates relevant technical and behavioral questions
4. **Voice Processing** - Uses Whisper for transcription and Kokoro for natural voice synthesis
5. **Feedback Analysis** - Provides detailed feedback on your responses with improvement suggestions

## Architecture

```
Interviewer App (Electron + React)
        |
        | HTTP API (localhost:13305)
        v
Lemonade Server
        |
        +-- LLM (llama.cpp) --> Interview logic, feedback
        +-- Whisper ---------> Speech-to-text
        +-- Kokoro ----------> Text-to-speech
```

## Troubleshooting

### Model Loading Issues
If models fail to load, check that Lemonade Server is running:
```bash
lemonade status
```

### Audio Not Working
Ensure your microphone and speakers are properly configured in your system settings.

### Slow Response Times
- Ensure you have enough RAM (32GB+ recommended for Qwen3-Coder-30B)
- Enable GPU acceleration if available
- Close other resource-intensive applications
